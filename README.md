# Wormhole Token List


This repository serves as a comprehensive reference guide, designed for both community members and developers. The purpose of this list is to provide detailed information about various tokens within the Wormhole ecosystem. 

Please note the following key points regarding this list:

- **Community and Developer Reference:** This list is primarily intended as a reference tool for both the Wormhole community and developers.
- **Token Metadata Propagation:** Adding a token to this list does not mean that the token's metadata will automatically be propagated across all Wormhole applications or Block Explorers. The inclusion in this list is a separate process from integration into individual Wormhole apps.
- **Primary Reference for Portal:** The information in this list is mainly used in conjunction with Portal Bridge. Developers and users working with Portal will find this list particularly useful for their operations and integrations.
- **Support and Questions:** If you have any questions regarding token availability on Portal please reach out to XLabs, who maintains the PortalBridge site. If you have any questions or need assistance regarding the use of this list or its applications, please reach out in the Discord.

This repository aims to be a dynamic and useful resource for the Wormhole community. We encourage you to contribute and participate in making this a valuable tool for everyone involved.
